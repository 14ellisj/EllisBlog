                <p>We woke up on Thursday and had our last plays with Elliot. We ate as much as we could to clear out the naughty foods from Rich & Angie’s house. Elliot looked sad to see us go and properly got his bottom lip out as Angie brought him out to wave us off.</p>

                <p><img src="day18.jpeg" alt="Day 18 Picture" class="imageBlog"></p>

                <p>We set off early so we could stop at UTC on the way and buy an iPhone. Just after we stopped for McDonald’s for lunch (for a last frozen Coke) we had some traffic issues as there was a van that had been on fire.</p>

                <p>Apart from that, everything was very smooth from dropping off the car to getting on the plane. No one got more than 2 hours sleep on the plane. Freya watched more horror movies and something with a naked Harry Styles.</p>

                <p>Again, all pretty smooth at Heathrow and Alison then drove us to Romford for our hotel stop. We arrived in almost perfect time for check-in and watching Grand Prix qualifying. After that we nipped to Bargain Madness and Greggs for some unhealthy tea before an early night ready for Formula E on Saturday to finish off our holiday.</p>
