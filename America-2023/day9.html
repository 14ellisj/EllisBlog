                <p>We needed a day off, so we lazed around the ranch in the morning. Some reading, some packing, some planning, some chat with friends and some Dance Moms.
                </p>

                <p>We aimed to arrive mid-afternoon for a public session at the rink. After a bit of stress trying to understand the parking meters, Jake found a spot in the rink’s car park. The rink had a Bradford vibe to it. There were about 8 people on when we arrived and maybe 20 when we left. Jake skating around a bit in some hire skates while Freya plucked up the courage to do some tricks. She said the ice was “plastic” and rubbish, but she built enough confidence to do a few things. Then said the ice was good as it made her spins faster.  A coach had a chat with her about where she was from and what skating she did. Me and Alison stayed, sat behind the plastiglass in shorts and not really that cold.
                </p>

                <p>We were out at teatime so ate out at Denny’s because it had a big menu and easy parking. The service was great and the food was huge. There were unlimited refills and when you got three-quarters down your drink, a new one appeared. We were all full.
                </p>

                <p>All except Alison went in the pool for a last hurrah. The kids jumped off the diving board. As dusk descended, the bugs got a bit bitey, so we moved to the hot tub for a last last hurrah, this time with all of us in. Jake lasted half a cycle of jets, Alison to the end, Freya a few minutes into the second one but I held out, drinking the Smirnoff Ice cans that Freya bought but didn’t like.
                </p>

                <p>We have an early start so were all packed and ready to go before having a relatively early night. That chill day was what we needed.</p>
