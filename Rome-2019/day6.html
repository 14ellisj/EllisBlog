                <p>Due to the amount of booze we had to try and use up on Wednesday I forgot to mention the cat that had walked from one apartment to another while we were having tea. Nothing unusual about that, you might think, but there were no connecting balconies and plenty of opportunities for someone inside to open a window and knock it off.</p>

                <p>Here it is on StreetView, which for the less technologically minded, isn’t live, so it’s the wrong time of day:</p>

                <p>Thursday morning, we were all ready before the taxis arrived, despite the nearest bottle bank being a quarter of a kilometre away. Maurizio was nowhere in sight, but C remembered he had said to leave the keys on the table, so we did.</p>

                <p>N&P&C got the Mercedes again, the rest of us got an Opel van, but at least we were in charge of our air conditioning. After some initial Roman congestion we were at the airport fairly quickly. </p>

                <p>Jet 2 had sent us an email saying how terrible security was. We were through in no time and, after exiting the stinky perfume shop as fast as possible, once again had two hours to fill. We found some chairs where we could sit and watch the final nuns of the holiday.</p>

                <p>On the plane I tried to put my phone in my pocket by unzipping the bottom of my trouser leg and sticking the phone in it, which slid down my leg on to the floor. I was glad to have not done the same in Rome, although now I think about it, the leg ends had stayed permanently detached, even at St Peter’s where I had them in my pocket in case of emergencies.</p>

                <p>The weather was hazy, so not much of a view apart from Mont Blanc, which was tall enough to stick out of it.  Then proper clouds turned up and I slept between Reims and Derby, when they woke us all up. I had been hoping to see Rog on the ferry back from PB.                </p>

                <p>Back in Manchester we were reassured by the captain that it was dry. Consequently, it rained on us on the way to the car park. </p>

                <p>After saying goodbye to C&A&J&F we all got in the car, except Papy, who got stuck trying to get in the front seat. Unlike the 20 minutes he spent trapped in the back of Chesk’s Fiat 500, this was easily rectified by putting the seat further back with C in the back pushing against it so it didn’t move too quickly.</p>

                <p>Back at N&P’s I tried to repay their kindness by repairing their toilet. I couldn’t, but I think I know what’s wrong and as we left they were arguing about how to best buy the replacement part using Papy’s phone.</p>

                <p>Thanks N&P!</p>
