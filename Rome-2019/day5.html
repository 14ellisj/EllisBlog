                <p>With the Italian breakfast letting us down, it was McDonald's on Wednesday. </p>

                <p>I was first up so went to see the gate in the walls at the end of our street. Despite how unlooked-after the area is, it’s still spectacular. No one else was taking any notice of it.</p>

                <p>Then off to Piazza di Spagna on the Metro. As we came out of the station Chris wondered how many of us would make it past Sephora without going in on our third visit. Amazingly, no one did. </p>

                <p>The McDonald’s chocolate croissant was, I’m afraid, the best of the week. Still a bit bendy though. I followed it up with a tiramisu. Not enough booze in it, even if it was 11am. </p>

                <p>Chesk had chips and two cheeseburgers. N&P had egg McMuffins, the smell of which, after typing on the Metro to tell C where to get off, didn’t do much for my wellbeing.</p>

                <p>Papy wanted to see a Caravagio, so we headed off to San Luigi dei Francesci, near the pantheon. He says it was disappointing because you can’t get close enough. It was seeing the brush strokes not tasting it he was interested in. Luckily, someone else put the money in the meter to turn the lights on.</p>

                <p>While we were in there Freya sat on the kerb outside and was told to stand up by the police.</p>

                <p>Then we headed down to Altare Della Patria, the Alter of the Fatherland. All the Ellises set off first while Chesk went to buy a hoodie. On the way I thought I’d nip in and see what the hole in the pantheon looks like in the sun. The girls were stopped for being underdressed. C has been saying all week that “No one is going to tell me what to wear” so turned round and left. Inside it looked like someone had put an awful lot of money in the meter to light up one corner.</p>

                <p>I’d been claiming all week that Mussolini had built Altere Della Patria, but while he might have been in charge when it was finished, it was started in 1880-something and was built to celebrate the unification of Italy. Nanny was happy, because it was the kind of fancy big building she had been hoping for all week. </p>

                <p>N&P sat on a bench while we headed up it. </p>

                <p>First 121 steps up to the church next to it, to find they don’t join up. I stopped C half way up. </p>

                <p>Next a similar number up to Campidoglio, a quite nice square and last thing on my go-to-see list. It had a rather good view of the forum, but no route up the Altar.</p>

                <p>We found a shady way down to the square and a gap in the fence and headed up. Half way up were some toilets and some indoor stairs, out of the sun.</p>

                <p>It was covered in bird shit (but with surprisingly few birds) but, I hate to say it, better than I expected.</p>

                <p>Too hot, so back on the bus to the house for lunch.</p>

                <p>We had lunch inside, then drinks in the garden, after Chris had cleaned the sticky ick from the furniture. I watched the Tour de France. I’m not sure about everyone else. </p>

                <p>Chesk came out for the final 15km in her hoodie. Rog texted to say there is a water shortage in PB and we may have to get water from a mobile tanker. C said she is not going if she can’t shower. “Bye!” Said Chesk. </p>

                <p>Papy said he was going for a shower and went in. Quarter of an hour later I found him drinking wine and eating cheesy poofs in the dining room. He did shower eventually and came out as Milton Jones again, in a shirt with parrots on.  </p>

                <p>Once I realised I was covered in mosquitoes Chris suggested we find the famous local art work of a Cheshire Cat, smoking. His art appreciation turned out to be Pokemon hunting, but it got us out and Jake found a Lego shop he had missed previously because he had been admiring the world’s smallest petrol station. Small, but not quiet and at least 5 vehicles were serviced while they were in there. Chris spent €0.50 on a Lego lemon lolly with a liquorice stick. </p>

                <p>When we got back Nanny and Alison turned up in the kitchen in towels. It seems the toga party started without me. </p>

                <p>I had a drink on the roof but no one joined me and when I got downstairs everyone was ready to go out. Jake dashed in with a joke: a Roman goes into a bar, holds up two fingers and says “Five beers please”. </p>

                <p>We had tea at the same place we had dinner on Saturday, il Padellaccio 2. They seemed pleased to have us back. While there on Saturday I looked at the traffic and suggested a sweepstake for when the first car crash would be. I went for 3:30 Saturday afternoon. It was actually while we were sitting outside the restaurant eating tea. Screech, bang, cheers. </p>

                <p>The strange man on his own smoking and not eating turned out to be the owner and he was laughing at Chesk doing amusing filters on Snapchat. He asked her to do one of him, so she did a baby face one that made him years younger. He nearly wet himself and we got free lemon puddings. </p>

                <p>Back at the house we tried to work out what the forum had been doing for 2000 years, whilst finishing off the Cornettos and limoncello. I found a picture from the 1600s before it was excavated, but it looked much the same. They must have just uncovered the low bits. </p>

                <p>Off home today in some Roman weekday traffic. Hopefully that’s all the car crashes out of the way. </p>
