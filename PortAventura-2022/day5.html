               <p>Time for a pause today.
            </p>

               <p>Late breakfast then chilling around the pool. Alison spotted a couple of loungers and a parasol on the walk back from breakfast. She bagged them - good work.
            </p>

               <p>The rest of us steadily left our rooms to use the loungers and the pool over the next hour or so, in a chilled manner. I dared to go in the pool, which was a pleasant cooling compared to in the sun.
            </p>

               <p>Once the three “kids” were out together, pool time descended into splashing so I retired to the lounger. Both me and Alison enjoyed our books in the shade and sun as lunchtime crept up on us.
            </p>

               <p>I tried to find the F1 on the TV in the room and failed. So I had to make do with Jack Nicholls’ commentary. I will definitely be watching the highlights of the actual race.
            </p>

               <p>While I was listening, we walked to the closest proper supermarket for some lunch and snacks. Again, I cannot report on the chat for that 90 minutes.
            </p>

               <p>After the late lunch, we went into the theme park for wet rides. The sensible crew had swimming gear on and no bags that could get wet. Our plan was Tutuki splash (slow 4-person wide log flume where all 24 riders get soaked from head to toe) then Angkor (slow boat ride where you fire water cannons at each other and every rider gets soaked from head to toe). All good fun. All soaked. Unfortunately, the actual log flume isn’t working so we went back to the hotel.
            </p>

               <p>We had the middle-time buffet and it was very calm. I tried to have a plate of starter then a plate of main for a change, which worked really well. Jenny was a bit radical and had chicken noodle soup, described as “noodly”.
            </p>

               <p>The kids went back to their rooms while the oldies had a drink in the bar (not outside where my calves can be more bitten) and watched the promo video for Ferrari Land. We have agreed that Alison will be done in 90 minutes and I will be there all day.

               <p>In case you were wondering, ants like the sugary caffeinated drink called Monster.

               <p>Jake says these emails only work if you read them in my sarcastic and cynical voice. I have no idea what he means.</p>
