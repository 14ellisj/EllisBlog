                <p>Another busy day with resting of eyes in the afternoon.
                </p>                    

                <p>Let‚Äôs start with errors and omissions from yesterday. Error: it wasn‚Äôt üí©, just a nut/seed/flower from a tree. Omission: at 5amin the airport a child had an ice cream - what kind of parent lets kids have ice cream for breakfast on holiday, Ali and Steve?
                </p>

                <p>Early breakfast and then a walk into Salou before it got too hot. We wanted to soak up the Spanish and Catal√°n culture while we were here. Straight to McDonald‚Äôs, obviously. It wasn‚Äôt open, which was a bit sad.
                </p>

                <p>The kids played on a swing on the beach and then we walked to the end of the beach before some air-conditioned shopping. We aimed for our favourite, Ale-Hop, which had some great stuff. Freya bought some dresses in one of the million womenswear shops.
                </p>

                <p>We wandered back across Salou aiming for the now-open McDonald‚Äôs. So much choice! Freya rightly says we are being short-changed in the UK. An annoying man selling knock-off football kits spoiled the vibe and I had to save the kids from some harassment at one point.
                </p>

                <p>The kids went back to the pool as the oldies did the coastal path. It was a great way to see all the coves and beaches. It was hot so we stopped and Alison had sex on the beach (picture below). I just had a beer. After a less-amusingly named cocktail and another beer, we staggered back on the roads in a more direct route back to the hotel.
                </p>

                <p>The kids had practiced a pool show while we walked, which they insisted on showing us. This was a tradition from when they were little and generally involved clumsily choreographed spinning and arm waving. I was usually the unsmiling muscle throwing them around. Jake has taken on my role and elevated the unsmiling style to a new level. The girls might want to practise their synchronisation skills a bit more.

                <p>Eyes rested, sweat showered off, sun cream on ready to go into the theme park. How was it only 5pm?
                </p>

                <p>Once we saw the queue times, we decided to go the air-conditioned Sesame Street indoor shooty ride. It was excellent. I had to close my eyes in the immersive bit. The key thing is that Jake won and Freya doesn‚Äôt know the difference between red and orange.
                </p>

                <p>The kids squeezed in a ride and I walked up a plastic tree.
                </p>

                <p>Our dinner was booked for 8. It was 7. The queue for Furious Baco was 50 minutes. We took the risk and the queue time was bang on. The three young ‚Äòuns got the front row on this fast-starting Rita clone. Alison swore many times during the 3-second acceleration at the start.
                </p>

                <p>We got vouchers to the Italian at the theme park in place of our half-board buffet. Alison said ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù and the alarms went off. Only a supervisor could take her order and bring her food. Erika would have been proud.
                </p>

                <p>The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù waitress forgot that the other four of us might also want some food, which slowed things down a bit. While waiting, some pirates came on a ship down the road to be joined by some other pirates from a secret door. They did some dancing and, very impressively, spinning of barrels on tables on their feet. I‚Äôm sure the main character‚Äôs similarity to Jack Sparrow and the music to the Pirates of the Caribbean was purely coincidental.
                </p>

                <p>The kids came straight back to the hotel. The oldies went via a supermarket for some two-and-a-half-Euro sangria.</p>

                <p>Good night. Hic</p>
